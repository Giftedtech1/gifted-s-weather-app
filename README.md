Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Giftedtech Precious, and this is a simple but functional weather app I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and lets you check the current weather and 5-day forecast for any city you search.

*Why I Built This*

This was a personal project to help me practice:

Working with APIs

Organizing code with JavaScript classes

Making my first public project with Git and GitHub

Deploying a website with GitHub Pages

I also wanted something that actually works and could be useful for real users â€” even if itâ€™s just to check the weather before heading out ðŸ˜„

*What It Can Do*
âœ… Search for any city in the world

âœ… See real-time weather (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.)

âœ… View a 5-day forecast

âœ… Animated preloader (using my logo)

âœ… Mobile-friendly layout

âœ… Keeps your API key safe (locally, with config.js i left the API key cus its free im not paying for it and no damages can be caused
